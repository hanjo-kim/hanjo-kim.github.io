Welcome to my personal website. I am a Financial Economist at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. My research interests are in international trade and macroeconomics. I focus on how household or firm heterogeneity interacts with aggregate dynamics in open economies. I am also responsible for updating a suite of Treasury and corporate yield curves.  

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Vanderbilt University. 

The views presented are those of the author and not necessarily those of the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the U.S. Government.
